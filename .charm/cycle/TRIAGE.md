# Triage — C6 sources

<!-- Per-cycle triage INBOX for actionable items surfaced out-of-band: code-review and
     validate findings, bugs / in-scope issues discovered during build that were not
     anticipated in the plan, work deliberately skipped per the escalation matrix (high,
     non-blocking, work-shaped), and the consequences of plan-invalidating discoveries.
     NOT a backlog and NOT a decision log (judgment questions go to DECISIONS.md).

     Only charm-replan parses items in full; every other role reads this inbox at summary
     level (count, severities, items referenced by blocked tasks).

     Lifecycle: consume-and-clear. Items are added `open`, then triaged by charm-replan per
     the escalation matrix — promoted to a PLAN.md task (with an acceptance criterion),
     deferred beyond this cycle into ROADMAP.md Unscheduled, recorded as a DECISIONS.md entry
     (wontfix), or dropped with a reason. Once triaged, the item is removed here (the outcome
     lives in PLAN / ROADMAP / DECISIONS). This doc stays small by construction; if it is
     growing, that means triage is overdue. It must be empty before a cycle can close.

     Keep one line per item. Ids (T1, T2…) are transient scratch labels, not durable keys —
     they are only for referring to an item until it is triaged, and may be reused after
     the inbox is cleared. Cite like findings: filepath:line. Severity is the reporter's
     estimate, not ground truth — triage filters false positives and wontfix.

| T14 | build | low | .charm/GLOSSARY.md:77 | Navigator glossary entry still says "Roots Nav above" despite the C6 rename to Sources Nav recorded at lines 114-120 (self-inconsistency, doc-only, found while doing M1.6) | open |

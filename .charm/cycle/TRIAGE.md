# Triage — C4 recall

<!-- Per-cycle triage INBOX for actionable items surfaced out-of-band: code-review and
     validate findings, bugs / in-scope issues discovered during build that were not
     anticipated in the plan, work deliberately skipped per the escalation matrix (high,
     non-blocking, work-shaped), and the consequences of plan-invalidating discoveries.
     NOT a backlog and NOT a decision log (judgment questions go to DECISIONS.md).

     Only charm-replan parses items in full; every other role reads this inbox at summary
     level (count, severities, items referenced by blocked tasks).

     Lifecycle: consume-and-clear. Items are added `open`, then triaged by charm-replan per
     the escalation matrix — promoted to a PLAN.md task (with an acceptance criterion),
     deferred beyond this cycle into ROADMAP.md Unscheduled, recorded as a DECISIONS.md entry
     (wontfix), or dropped with a reason. Once triaged, the item is removed here (the outcome
     lives in PLAN / ROADMAP / DECISIONS). This doc stays small by construction; if it is
     growing, that means triage is overdue. It must be empty before a cycle can close.

     Keep one line per item. Ids (T1, T2…) are transient scratch labels, not durable keys —
     they are only for referring to an item until it is triaged, and may be reused after
     the inbox is cleared. Cite like findings: filepath:line. Severity is the reporter's
     estimate, not ground truth — triage filters false positives and wontfix.

| T44 | review | low | test/pty/checks.py:1028 | M6.3's widened-height comment says the dv1Pane Help Modal box is "8 scrollActions + 22 explicit bindings"; the actual explicit-binding count is 23 (verified: `len(helpBindings(dv1Pane))-len(scrollActions)` = 23 in a scratch test), so 8+23+title/blank(2)+border(2) = 35 matches the stated total, but the cited breakdown itself is off by one. Harmless (no test depends on the literal count) but misleading to a future maintainer re-deriving the row math. Fix: correct "22" to "23". | open |

# Progress — C4 recall

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M6.2

## Handoff

<!-- Overwrite each session. 5–15 lines. Enough for a fresh agent to continue:
     state of the current task, in-flight changes, surprises/gotchas, next step, blockers. -->

M6.1 built: per-viewer back/forward document history (S9). `viewer` gained `history
[]string`/`historyPos int` plus `pushHistory`/`canGoBack`/`canGoForward`/`goBack`/
`goForward` (viewer.go) — browser semantics (adjacent-duplicate suppression at push time,
forward-truncation on a new push) live entirely in `pushHistory`. A new `model.navigate(p,
d)` wraps the existing `openDocumentInto` and is the only thing that calls `pushHistory`;
it replaces `openDocumentInto` at exactly the five "real navigation" call sites
(`openDocument`, `activateInto`, `activateFlatRowInto`, `activatePickerInto`,
`activateGrepPickerInto`) while `openDocumentInto` itself — and its ~39 other call sites,
mostly test fixtures — stays untouched, so finishEdit (the $EDITOR handoff) and Refresh
(refreshDoc, not open, never touches navigate at all) both correctly create no entries with
zero special-casing. `model.walkViewerHistory` (historyBack/historyForward) re-reads the
target path from disk and writes the moved viewer back only on a successful load — a read
failure leaves the history position exactly where it was, mirroring activate()'s own
refusal shape. New keys `[`/`]` (HistoryBack/HistoryForward), matched in Update's
dv1Pane/dv2Pane case beside keys.Star (each viewer owns its own history). DV2's history
needs no explicit teardown: it lives on the `*viewer` struct itself, so closeDV2 dropping
the pointer already drops it, and a freshly re-created DV2 starts at the zero value.

Design judgment calls (key chords, launch seeding history entry 0, silent-no-op boundary
instead of a footer message, the navigate-wrapper-not-signature-change shape) logged as
D90 rather than escalated — none contradicted by SPEC/PLAN wording, all low-risk.
Discoverability (Footer hints, Help Modal listing) deliberately not wired this session,
matching the M2.8/M4.8 precedent of shipping the mechanism first — logged as TRIAGE T41.

All new: history_test.go — 8 tests covering independent DV1/DV2 sequences, both history
boundaries, forward-truncation on a post-Back Activate, no-adjacent-duplicate, no entry
from the $EDITOR handoff or Refresh, the Active Root staying put while history walks into
another Root's document, and DV2's history dying with DV2. `make check` and `make
check-pty` both green. Next: M6.2 (per-document scroll memory in history) is a pre-agreed
cut — check TRIAGE/DECISIONS state before starting since the cycle may choose to drop it
per SPEC.md's ordered cut list; M7.1/M7.2 (pane focus badges) are otherwise next in plan
order and fully independent if M6.2 is dropped.

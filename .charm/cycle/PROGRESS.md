# Progress — C4 recall

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M4.1

## Handoff

<!-- Overwrite each session. 5–15 lines. Enough for a fresh agent to continue:
     state of the current task, in-flight changes, surprises/gotchas, next step, blockers. -->

Build (2026-08-11): completed M3.5. Added
`TestPickerActivateStoreWriteFailureSurfacesMessage` (new file,
cmd/noggin/recency_picker_store_write_failure_test.go), mirroring M3.4's
`TestActivateStoreWriteFailureSurfacesMessage` for the Picker's two `recordViewed` call
sites: a "file Result" subtest (activatePickerInto) and a "grep Result" subtest
(activateGrepPickerInto), both forcing the store write to fail via the existing
`storeWriteFailurePath` helper and asserting the resulting message reflects the store
failure verbatim while the document still opens. `make check` green; both subtests pass
individually verified.

Validate (2026-08-11): closed the Reviewed/Validated gap flagged in the previous handoff.
Deterministic: `make check` and `make check-pty` both green (full run, all pty checks
passed). Verified independently: M1.1a (`config_env` in test/pty/checks.py resolves via the
same dataDir()/storePath() logic as cmd/noggin/docstore.go, main.go, model.go; M3.3's Roots
pane listing/marking/persistence pty checks all pass), M2.10 (checks.py:582-588 confirms the
status+star+name row layout, `"M   tracked.md"` present, and the C2a/M4.1 pty checks pass),
M2.12 (picker_view.go:282-290's comment now correctly says only Picker rows call
starMarker(); Roots/Files/DV render the literal independently), M2.13
(TestPickerStarTogglingUpdatesTheRenderedMarkerLiveInGrepMode drives a real m.View() through
a Grep-mode PickerStar toggle, asserts the marker appears/clears same-frame — passes), M3.5
(TestPickerActivateStoreWriteFailureSurfacesMessage has file-Result and grep-Result subtests
mirroring M3.4's DV test — both pass). Stamped Validated 2026-08-11 for all five in
PROGRESS.md's Status table. No discrepancies found; no TRIAGE items raised.

Next: cursor is **M4.1** (mode/scope model + Files Nav mode/scope row) — ready (needs M1.4,
done). All done rows in M1-M3 now have Reviewed and Validated coverage; nothing blocks M4.1.

# Progress — C6 sources

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M8.4

## Handoff

**Build 2026-09-09 (M8.2a):** fixed TRIAGE T26's real bug — at a pathologically short terminal
(`boxHeight` 0, e.g. 80x4 once `computeLayout`'s border/title math leaves nothing) DV1's
`docContentHeight` already floored the viewport at 0, but `composeViewerContent`
(location.go) still appended the S9 location line unconditionally whenever a document was
open, handing `renderBox` one more line than its `MaxHeight` budget allowed — observed as the
pane's *bottom border* silently disappearing (MaxHeight clips from the end, not the line that
overflowed) rather than the frame growing. Fixed by gating `docLocationVisible`/
`peekLocationVisible` on `v.boxHeight >= 1` (following `computeLayout`'s own `staleRow`
"never claim a row you weren't budgeted" precedent) — both callers (`contentHeight`,
`viewerLocationLine`) already keyed off these two booleans, so the one gate fixes both the
reserved-height math and the drawn line together. Also folded `docContentHeight`/
`peekContentHeight` into a shared `contentHeight(locationVisible bool)` helper (TRIAGE T28).
Added `TestLocationLineNeverClaimsARowAtAPathologicallyShortTerminal`
(`sized(t, m, 80, 4)`-then-`openDocument`, per the AC) — confirmed it fails on the pre-fix code
(border row missing) and passes post-fix. `make check` and `make check-pty` (268 checks) both
green.

Next step: cursor moved to M8.4 (next todo task in key order; independent,
pull-forward-anytime task per PLAN.md — `scrollActions`' stale S12 citation in viewer.go).
M9.2 remains independent; M10.1 (README, last task) should come after those since it
documents the behaviour/citations they touch. No blockers.

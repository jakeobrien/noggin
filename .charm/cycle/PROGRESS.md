# Progress — C6 sources

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M1.11

## Handoff

**Replan 2026-09-09 (post-M9.1, pre-M10.1):** reconciled a cursor/status mismatch — the prior
validate pass had already flipped M1.11 back to `in-progress` (its checks.py:164 clause unmet,
TRIAGE T30) but the handoff's cursor line still pointed at M10.1. Cursor corrected to M1.11.
TRIAGE.md's 8 open items all routed and the inbox is now empty: T30 dropped (already covered
by M1.11's own unmet clause, no new task needed); T26 (high, real location-line overflow bug
at pathologically short terminals) merged with T28 (dup-code nit, same functions) into new
task M8.2a; T29 (medium, real SGR-7/colour-param misdetection in `tintPaneBackground`)
promoted to new task M9.2; T24+T25 (stale/mis-cited store.go doc comments) merged into new
task M7.4; T27 (ambiguous bare "(S12)" citation, now collides with M8.1's own S12) promoted to
new task M8.4; T31 (duplicated doc comment across two wikipedia test files) promoted to new
task M2.11. All low/medium severity, same routine hygiene/bugfix shape as this cycle's earlier
triage batches — no spec change. D135/D136 log the two medium+/high-severity fixes (T26/M8.2a,
T29/M9.2); the low-severity doc-comment nits (T24, T25, T27, T28, T31) didn't warrant an entry.
Full task text in PLAN.md.

Next step: finish M1.11 (fix the one missed "Roots"→"Sources" description string at
checks.py:164, per its existing acceptance criterion). Then M2.11, M7.4, M8.2a, M8.4, M9.2
are independent and can be pulled in any order. M10.1 (README, last task) should come after
M8.2a/M8.4/M9.2 since those touch the behaviour/citations M10.1 will document. No blockers.

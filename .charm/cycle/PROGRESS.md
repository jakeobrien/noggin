# Progress — C4 recall

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M5.1

## Handoff

<!-- Overwrite each session. 5–15 lines. Enough for a fresh agent to continue:
     state of the current task, in-flight changes, surprises/gotchas, next step, blockers. -->

M4.11 (2026-08-12): fixed TRIAGE T27/T28, purely mechanical, no behavior change. Seven
literal `\u2014` (real backslash-u-2014 text, not a processed em dash) inside `//` comments
in browse_list.go, plus three more in browse_list_test.go, replaced with an actual em dash
— left every quoted-string-literal reference alone (e.g. picker_view.go's `"\u2605 "`,
files.go's `" \u00b7 "`), since those describe a real code literal rather than being a
broken comment glyph themselves. Also fixed the wrong "scope.go's modeScopes" citation
(modeScopes is defined in browse.go) in both places it appeared: browse_list.go:163 and
browse_starred_test.go:78 (the acceptance wording's "both citations", not one in
browse_list_test.go as the task's own phrasing loosely implied — grep found none there).
`make check` green (go test -count=1, not just cached).

Next: M5.1 — add `Starred` as a third Picker scope value (File and Grep Picker), resolving to
the whole document store rather than a set of Roots. Grep-side Starred is pre-agreed cut 4.

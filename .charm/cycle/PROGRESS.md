# Progress — C6 sources

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M8.2a

## Handoff

**Build 2026-09-09 (M7.4):** two stale `cmd/noggin/store.go` doc comments fixed (TRIAGE
T24/T25). `storedRoot` (store.go:82) said toggleStore was the only writer "besides a future
rename (M7.2)" though M7.2 landed this same cycle — now names both toggleStore and
renameStore plainly as its two writers, present tense throughout.
`escapeStoreField`/`unescapeStoreField` (store.go:231) cited D61 (document-memory-is-global,
unrelated) to justify the Roots/Document stores' separate escaping code — now cites D21/D67
(the actual Roots-store and Document-store line-format decisions), naming which is which.
`make check` (build/vet/fmt/test) green.

Next step: cursor moved to M8.2a (next todo task in key order; independent,
pull-forward-anytime task per PLAN.md — TRIAGE T26 location-line overflow bug + T28 dedup
nit). M8.4, M9.2 remain independent and can be pulled in any order; M10.1 (README, last task)
should come after those since it documents the behaviour/citations they touch. No blockers.

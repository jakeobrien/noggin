# Progress — C4 recall

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M2.12

## Handoff

<!-- Overwrite each session. 5–15 lines. Enough for a fresh agent to continue:
     state of the current task, in-flight changes, surprises/gotchas, next step, blockers. -->

Build (2026-08-11): completed M2.10. `test/pty/checks.py`'s C2a/M4.1 git-status-marker
checks assumed the pre-M2.3 row layout (status marker directly adjacent to the file name,
e.g. `"M tracked.md"`); M2.3 inserted a two-column star-marker field between status and name,
so the same unstarred-modified row now reads `"M   tracked.md"` (one status column + one
blank star column). Updated the four affected checks (`tracked.md`, `new.md`, the `clean.md`
absence pair, and the non-repo-Root `note.md` absence pair) to the new exact strings rather
than loosening them. `make check` and `make check-pty` both green (all pty checks pass,
including the updated C2a/M4.1 group).

Next: cursor moved to **M2.12** (correct `starMarker()`'s doc comment, TRIAGE T17/D76) —
small, ready (needs M2.11, which is done). M2.13 and M3.5 are also ready and unblocked;
pick up in any order.

# Progress — C6 sources

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M8.2b (replan-added test-gap task, todo) — the cycle's one remaining build
item. All of M1-M10 plus M1.12/M9.3 are otherwise `done`; validation is still outstanding
for 9 of those (see below) and now waits behind M8.2b's own build+review.

## Handoff

**Replan 2026-09-10 (eighth pass):** a fresh-context code review (this session's
predecessor) covered the 7 tasks TRIAGE T35 had reset (M1.11, M2.11, M7.4, M8.2a, M8.4,
M9.2, M8.5): all 7 confirmed faithful to their PLAN.md acceptance criteria, no scope creep,
`make check` green — Reviewed stamps set to 2026-09-10 in the Status table below (Validated
left `-`, unchanged). The review's one finding, T36 (low — M8.2a's own regression test
covers only the Active-Document path; the Peek path, gated by the same `boxHeight >= 1`
check and named explicitly in M8.2a's own task text, has no boxHeight-0 test of its own) —
triaged now: accepted as PLAN task **M8.2b** (same test-gap convention already used for
T31/T34), not deferred or wontfixed (too small/mechanical for ROADMAP, not a declined idea).
No DECISIONS.md entry (low severity, not material). TRIAGE.md is empty again. Also trimmed
PLAN.md's stale ordering-note sentence that still named M1.11 as the in-progress cursor
(it has been `done` since replan's seventh pass).

Next step: build M8.2b (small, single-session — a Peek-path counterpart to M8.2a's own
regression test), then review+validate it. Once M8.2b is done, the next session should run
charm-validate (fresh context) covering all 9 previously-unvalidated tasks (M1.11, M2.11,
M7.4, M8.2a, M8.4, M9.2, M8.5, M1.12, M9.3) plus M8.2b itself, and confirm the whole cycle
(M1-M10) remains green, then `charm-security-review`, then `/charm-close`. No blockers.

# Progress — C6 sources

<!-- Per-cycle. Cursor and statuses ONLY — no work summaries (git history carries those).
     The Handoff section is the single exception: overwrite it each session, never append.
     Statuses: todo | in-progress | done | blocked | deferred.
     Blocked rows reference the DECISIONS.md / TRIAGE.md item they wait on — the set of
     blocked rows is the cycle's blocking-issue list.

     Reviewed / Validated columns: date (yyyy-mm-dd) the task was last covered by code
     review / validate, or `-` if it never has been. Set per task key, by the role that
     performed the check — or the parent that dispatched it as a subagent — for exactly the
     tasks that check actually covered, never assumed for a whole milestone. This is what
     makes reviewed/validated state accurate across replans that insert tasks earlier,
     partial mid-milestone checks, and skipped end-of-milestone gates — a single cycle-wide
     checkpoint can't represent any of those. Clear a cell back to `-` when the task's code
     changes after that date (fix-ups, reopened work) — it needs re-covering. -->

## Cursor

Current task: M9.2

## Handoff

**Build 2026-09-09 (M8.4):** fixed the 5 bare `(S12)` citations the AC named (TRIAGE T27) —
`viewer.go:601`, `footer.go:168`, `keymap.go:15` (C1's help-modal sense) and
`files_search.go:18`/`283` (C2's query-threshold/result-cap sense) — each now qualified
`S12/C1` or `S12/C2` per `picker_view.go:192`'s existing disambiguation convention, since bare
`S12` now also resolves to this cycle's own half-page-paging item. Also dropped
`footer.go:168`'s stale "future help modal" wording (the modal has existed since M5.3) while
editing that exact line — same line, same phrase, not a separate scope expansion. `make
check` green.

Discovered mid-task: the same bare-`S12` ambiguity recurs at ~20 more sites beyond the AC's 5
(footer.go, keymap.go, help.go, picker.go, picker_view.go and their tests) — out of this
task's scope (its AC named exactly 5 sites), so logged as TRIAGE T32 for a future sweep rather
than expanded into here.

Next step: cursor moved to M9.2 (last independent todo task in key order —
`tintPaneBackground`'s SGR-7/colour-param misdetection bug per PLAN.md). M10.1 (README, last
task) should come after it since it documents the behaviour M9.2 touches. TRIAGE has one open
item (T32, low severity, non-blocking) for the next replan pass. No blockers.
